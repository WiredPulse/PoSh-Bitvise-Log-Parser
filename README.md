# Bitvise Log Parser
Bitvise SSH Server is an SSH server for Windows operating systems. The server logs a robust amount of data to its log file in some type of XML format. This script makes sense of the log file and outputs it to a CSV, which can be used to quickly identify the sequence of events. 

# Log Location
The logs are stored in the program folder in which the Bitvise SSH Server is installed. By default, the location is "[SystemRoot]\Program Files\Bitvise SSH Server\Logs" but could be changed, as needed or desired. 

# Disclaimer
There are a plethora of different properties that can be retrieved or translated. This script only captures some of them and certainly not the full list. Please add additional properties as needed or desired to meet your overall intent or environment.
